# Session Wrap-up Workflow

At the end of each coding session, follow this standardized process to properly document and commit all work:

## 1. Create Detailed Commit Messages
Write comprehensive commit messages that clearly describe:
- **Problem**: What issue was being addressed
- **Solution**: How the issue was resolved
- **Files Modified**: List the key files that were changed
- **Impact**: What the fix accomplishes for users

Use conventional commit format:
```
fix: resolve shader compilation error in 9-Point Mesh Gradient

- Fixed extra closing parenthesis in rand_offset function
- Cleared build cache to ensure changes take effect
- Updated both main site and video generator shader files

Files modified:
- site/src/lib/video-renderer/background-effects/effects/gradients/NinePointMeshGradientShader.ts
- video-gen-and-proc/src/components/effects/ninePointMeshGradient/NinePointMeshGradientShader.ts

```

## 2. Update Documentation
1. Add a new entry to `_docs/dev_diary/devlog.md` at the top of the file with:
- **Date**: Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Title**: Descriptive title of the work completed
- **Problem**: Clear description of the issue encountered
- **Root Cause**: Technical explanation of why the problem occurred
- **Solution**: Step-by-step breakdown of how the issue was resolved
- **Files Modified**: List of all files that were changed
- **Outcome**: Description of the final result and user impact

Follow this format:
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - Descriptive Title

**Problem:** [Clear description of the issue]

**Root Cause:** [Technical explanation of why it happened]

**Solution:**
1. [Step 1 description]
2. [Step 2 description]
3. [Step 3 description]

**Files Modified:**
- `/path/to/file1.ts`
- `/path/to/file2.tsx`

**Outcome:** [Description of final result and user impact]
```

2. Update `README.md` (root) with any relevant changes to features, usage instructions, or workflows introduced during the session. Ensure the "Last updated" date reflects the current day when modifications are made.

## 3. Commit and Push Changes
Execute the complete git workflow:
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Create commit with detailed message
git commit -m "[detailed commit message]"

# Push to remote repository
git push origin main
```
Make sure not to add the following to the commit message:
"ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude noreply@anthropic.com"


## 4. Verification
Ensure all changes are properly committed by:
- Checking `git status` shows no uncommitted changes
- Verifying the commit appears in the remote repository
- Confirming the dev log entry is present in `_docs/dev_diary/devlog.md`

This workflow ensures comprehensive documentation of all development work and maintains a clear history of project evolution for future reference.
