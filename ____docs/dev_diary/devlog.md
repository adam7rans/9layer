  "description": "perf: reduce backend request log noise and prevent duplicate frontend polling",
  "details": "Disabled Fastify per-request logging (disableRequestLogging) to eliminate high-volume info logs from /playback/state polling. Added a guard in IntegratedPlayer to ensure only one polling interval is created even under React StrictMode. This significantly reduces log spam while maintaining responsive playback state updates.",

  "description": "fix: resolve frontend integration issues - track loading, search, and playback controls",
  "details": "Fixed critical frontend integration problems preventing proper music library display and functionality. Resolved API response format mismatch where backend returned {success, tracks, total} but frontend expected nested data structure. Updated frontend API client to transform responses correctly. Fixed database query ordering from createdAt desc to alphabetical by artist/album/title, revealing all 1,300+ tracks from 77 artists instead of just recent Aphex Twin entries. Added 300ms search debounce and verified search works for existing artists (92 results for 'run' including RUN DMC). Fixed play button functionality by updating playTrack API to fetch playback state after starting tracks. All core functionality now working: track loading, search, and playback controls.",

  "description": "fix: resolve all TypeScript lint errors in backend-ts codebase",
  "details": "Comprehensively fixed all TypeScript compilation errors in the backend-ts project. Resolved import/export compatibility issues by properly configuring esModuleInterop and fixing module imports (path, fs, ws). Added Fastify type augmentation to enable prisma property access on FastifyInstance. Fixed Jest mock return type issues with proper TypeScript annotations for Promise<void> returns. Resolved WebSocket import patterns and Map iterator compatibility issues. Updated tsconfig.json to include test files in compilation scope. Added missing Artist and Album type definitions to api.types.ts. Backend is now fully type-safe and ready for testing phase.",

  "description": "fix: Enhance WebSocket connection stability and recovery for page refresh scenarios",
  "details": "Implemented robust WebSocket connection recovery system to address page refresh disconnection issues. Added aggressive reconnection logic with heartbeat monitoring every 3 seconds when disconnected. Enhanced usePlayerSocket hook with mounting delays to ensure stable connections. Added comprehensive connection status indicators (Connected/Connecting/Disconnected) with visual feedback. Implemented multiple reconnection triggers: page load detection, tab visibility changes, network reconnection events, and periodic heartbeat checks. Improved error handling and timeout detection for hanging connections. Users can now refresh the page without losing WebSocket connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted music playback experience.",

  "description": "fix: Complete auto-play functionality with user interaction compliance",
  "details": "Resolved critical infinite re-render loop causing audio to restart every 0.18 seconds by separating time sync from audio sync useEffect hooks. Implemented browser auto-play policy compliance by adding user interaction detection - auto-play now works after user clicks anywhere on the page. Fixed WebSocket state override prevention to maintain playback state. Enhanced backend with browser-based audio serving, optimized API queries, and comprehensive WebSocket command processing. Track loads successfully with metadata and plays continuously in browser tab as intended.",
