  "description": "fix: Complete auto-play functionality with user interaction compliance",
  "details": "Resolved critical infinite re-render loop causing audio to restart every 0.18 seconds by separating time sync from audio sync useEffect hooks. Implemented browser auto-play policy compliance by adding user interaction detection - auto-play now works after user clicks anywhere on the page. Fixed WebSocket state override prevention to maintain playback state. Enhanced backend with browser-based audio serving, optimized API queries, and comprehensive WebSocket command processing. Track loads successfully with metadata and plays continuously in browser tab as intended.",
