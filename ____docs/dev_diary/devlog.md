  "description": "fix: resolve volume control scaling, snapping, and default issues",
  "details": "Fixed three critical volume control issues: (1) 3300% scaling error by adding proper volume clamping to 0-1 range before multiplication, (2) slider handle snapping behavior by extending polling disable period from 2 to 3 seconds and improving volume normalization logic, (3) unreasonable default volume (10000%) by adding initialization effect to detect and correct backend volume >100. Enhanced volume handling with smart normalization that handles mixed 0-100 and 0-1 scales gracefully. Added defensive programming with multiple layers of validation to prevent display errors.",

  "description": "feat/ui+fix: add 'Play on this device' button, enable LAN/mobile via dynamic API base and dev CORS",
  "details": "Reintroduced and repositioned the local playback control as a clear button labeled 'Play on this device' under the track metadata. Switched frontend to a dynamic API base (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE override, else window hostname:8000) so phones on LAN resolve to the backend. Expanded backend CORS to allow LAN origins in non-production while keeping production locked down. This fixes 'Failed to fetch random track' on mobile and surfaces the local playback control on all devices.",

  "details": "Updated IntegratedPlayer to render 50x50 Previous/Play/Next controls for consistent sizing and accessibility. Added large 50x50 plus/minus action buttons directly under the track title/artist section to adjust rating. Ensured existing Heroicons imports are used and handlers are wired to analytics rating functions.",

  "description": "fix: prevent autoplay policy violations and correct Enable Audio button track id",
  "details": "Removed programmatic user-interaction flag setting from non-user actions (auto-advance/next) to comply with browser autoplay policies and reduce NotAllowedError noise. Updated the 'Enable Audio' button to invoke playback using the correct track identifier (id instead of youtubeId). Playback now starts cleanly after real user interaction and the help banner behaves accurately.",

  "details": "Fixed critical audio playback issues preventing music from playing on page load. Resolved NotAllowedError caused by attempting autoplay without user interaction by implementing proper user interaction detection with click/keydown/touchstart listeners. Added functional skip forward/backward buttons with proper track navigation and boundary checking. Implemented auto-advance functionality to automatically play next track when current track ends. Improved audio element synchronization with backend state and enhanced error handling with clear user feedback. Removed complex forced autoplay logic in favor of clean, browser-compliant audio management.",

  "details": "Fixed critical audio playback issues in 9layer music player. Corrected backend audio endpoint URL from /audio/ to /playback/audio/ which was causing 'NotSupportedError: no supported sources' errors. Implemented proper timeline seeking by adding direct audio element currentTime manipulation and backend seek API calls. Enhanced user interaction tracking to comply with browser autoplay policies. Improved timeline UI by increasing height from 2px to 20px for better clickability. All core audio functionality now working including play/pause, seeking, and volume control.",

  "details": "Disabled Fastify per-request logging (disableRequestLogging) to eliminate high-volume info logs from /playback/state polling. Added a guard in IntegratedPlayer to ensure only one polling interval is created even under React StrictMode.

  "details": "Fixed critical frontend integration problems preventing proper music library display and functionality. Resolved API response format mismatch where backend returned {success, tracks, total} but frontend expected nested data structure. Updated frontend API client to transform responses correctly. Fixed database query ordering from createdAt desc to alphabetical by artist/album/title, revealing all 1,300+ tracks from 77 artists instead of just recent Aphex Twin entries. Added 300ms search debounce and verified search works for existing artists (92 results for 'run' including RUN DMC). Fixed play button functionality by updating playTrack API to fetch playback state after starting tracks. All core functionality now working: track loading, search, and playback controls.",

Added Fastify type augmentation to enable prisma property access on FastifyInstance. Fixed Jest mock return type issues with proper TypeScript annotations for Promise<void> returns. Resolved WebSocket import patterns and Map iterator compatibility issues. Updated tsconfig.json to include test files in compilation scope. Added missing Artist and Album type definitions to api.types.ts. Backend is now fully type-safe and ready for testing phase.",

  "details": "Implemented robust WebSocket connection recovery system to address page refresh disconnection issues. Added aggressive reconnection logic with heartbeat monitoring every 3 seconds when disconnected. Enhanced usePlayerSocket hook with mounting delays to ensure stable connections. Added comprehensive connection status indicators (Connected/Connecting/Disconnected) with visual feedback. Implemented multiple reconnection triggers: page load detection, tab visibility changes, network reconnection events, and periodic heartbeat checks. Improved error handling and timeout detection for hanging connections. Users can now refresh the page without losing WebSocket connectivity, ensuring uninterrupted music playback experience.",

Fixed WebSocket state override prevention to maintain playback state. Enhanced backend with browser-based audio serving, optimized API queries, and comprehensive WebSocket command processing. Track loads successfully with metadata and plays continuously in browser tab as intended.",
